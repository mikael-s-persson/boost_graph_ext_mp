<br>
Choosing the <tt>Edgelist</tt> and <tt>VertexList</tt>
</h2>

<p>
This section focuses on how to decide which version of the 
<a href="./linked_tree_BC.html"><tt>linked_tree_BC</tt></a> class 
to use in different situations. The <tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> is like a
swiss-army knife in that it can be configured in many ways. The
parameters that we will focus on in this section are <tt>OutEdgeList</tt>
and <tt>VertexList</tt>, which control the underlying data structures
that will be used to represent the tree.  The choice of
<tt>OutEdgeList</tt> and <tt>VertexList</tt> affects the time complexity
of many of the tree operations and the space complexity of the tree
object.

<p>
The <tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> class uses containers from the 
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/container.html">Boost.Container</a> 
such as <tt>boost::container::vector</tt>, <tt>boost::container::list</tt>,
<tt>boost::unordered_set</tt>, and <tt>boost::container::set</tt>
to represent the set of vertices and the links 
(out-edges) of the tree.  There are several selector
types that are used to specify the choice of container for
<tt>OutEdgeList</tt> and <tt>VertexList</tt>.

<p>

<ul>
<li><tt>vecBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::container::vector</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>poolBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::container::vector</tt> that allows "holes" in a 
similar way to <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/pool/‎">Boost.Pool</a>.</li>
<li><tt>listBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::container::list</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>setBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::container::set</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>multisetBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::container::multiset</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>unordered_setBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::unordered_set</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>unordered_multisetBC</tt> selects <tt>boost::unordered_multiset</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Choosing the <tt>VertexList</tt> type</h3>

<p>
The <tt>VertexList</tt> parameter determines what kind of container
will be used to represent the vertex set, or two-dimensional structure
of the tree.  The container must model <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Sequence.html">Sequence</a> or
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/RandomAccessContainer.html">RandomAccessContainer</a>. 
In general, <tt>listBC</tt> or <tt>poolBC</tt> is a good choice if you need to add and remove
vertices quickly. The price for this is extra space overhead and highly reduced locality of 
reference as compared to choosing <tt>vecBC</tt>.

<p>
You will also want to take into account the differences in time and space
complexity for the various tree operations. Below we use <i>V</i> for
the total number of vertices in the tree, which is also equal to the total
number of edges.  Operations not discussed here are constant time.

<p>

<h4>Space Complexity</h4>

<p>
The choice of <tt>VertexList</tt> affects the space complexity in the following ways:

<ul>


<li>
<pre>
vecBC
</pre>
The <tt>vecBC</tt> is the most compact storage and only has <i>O(1)</i> overhead
for the internal pointers of the <tt>boost::container::vector</tt> object 
itself, but it has no per-vertex space overhead (stores only vertex properties
and the out-edge lists).
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
listBC
</pre>
The <tt>listBC</tt> has a higher per-vertex space overhead than the
<tt>vecBC</tt>, storing two extra pointers (front/back) per vertex.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
poolBC
</pre>
The <tt>poolBC</tt> container has a per-vertex space overhead of about the 
<tt>sizeof(int)</tt> (depending on alignment) compared to <tt>vecBC</tt> 
because it stores vertices in discriminated unions, through the use of 
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/variant/‎">Boost.Variant</a>,
to discriminate valid from invalid vertices ("holes").
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
setBC, multisetBC, unordered_setBC, unordered_multisetBC
</pre>
The containers <tt>setBC</tt>, <tt>multisetBC</tt>, <tt>unordered_setBC</tt>, 
and <tt>unordered_multisetBC</tt> are <b>not allowed</b> for <tt>VertexList</tt> because 
there is no useful ordering or hashing possible here. If you want some indexing
of the vertices, you must do so externally (e.g., an associative container of 
vertex descriptor).

</ul>

<p>

<h4>Time Complexity</h4>

<p>
The choice of <tt>VertexList</tt> affects the time complexity of the
following operations.

<ul>

<li>
<pre>
add_child_vertex(v, g)
</pre>
For <tt>vecBC</tt>, this operation is amortized constant time, as it uses 
<tt>push_back()</tt> on a vector container. 
For <tt>poolBC</tt>, this operation is also amortized constant time overall, 
as it could use <tt>push_back()</tt> on a vector container, but when there are 
holes to be re-used, its complexity is constant time.
For <tt>listBC</tt>, this operations is constant time in the sense that it
uses <tt>push_back()</tt> on a list container, but it causes a dynamic allocation
of a new node, and such heap invocations are amortized constant time.
With either <tt>vecBC</tt> or <tt>poolBC</tt>, this operation will occasionally 
cause reallocated and the copying (or, moving in C++11) of all the vertices.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
remove_branch(u,g)
</pre>
Say, the number of vertices in the sub-tree rooted at <tt>u</tt> is <i>R</i>.
This operation is <i>O(R)</i> for both <tt>listBC</tt> and <tt>poolBC</tt>.
For <tt>vecBC</tt>, things are a bit more complicated. Since it relies on 
the <tt>remove_if()</tt> function on a vector container, it causes <i>O(V)</i> 
copies of the vertices (to "re-pack" the vertices) (note: copying of out-edge lists
is avoided). But then, because the vertex indices must be adjusted in all edges
of the tree that might refer to vertices that were shifted, there is an additional
time complexity of <i>O(V)</i> for that operation. And thus, <tt>vecBC</tt> incurs 
<i>O(V) (copy) + O(V) (adjust desc.)</i> time complexity per vertex removed, 
i.e., the overall complexity is <i>O(R*V)</i>.

<li>
<pre>
vertex_iterator::operator++()
</pre>
This operation is constant time in all cases.
However, there is a significant constant factor time difference
between the various <tt>VertexList</tt> types, which is important since 
this operation is the work-horse of many graph algorithms. The speed of
this operation in order of fastest to slowest is
<tt>vecBC</tt>, <tt>poolBC</tt>, <tt>listBC</tt>, <tt>setBC</tt>,
<tt>unordered_setBC</tt>.
Note that if traversals are frequent and a significant part of the operations
done with the tree, locality of reference can be a significant performance 
factor and it is recommended to use compact / contiguous containers 
like <tt>vecBC</tt> or <tt>poolBC</tt>.
<p></p>


</ul>

 
<p>

<h3><a name="SECTION00831200000000000000">
Choosing the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> type</a>
</h3>

<p>
The <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> parameter determines what kind of container will
be used to store the out-edges for each vertex in the tree. The containers used for edge lists must either satisfy
the requirements for <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Sequence.html">Sequence</a> or for
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/AssociativeContainer.html">AssociativeContainer</a>.

<p>
If the order of out-edges is important, then note that using the 
sequence containers <tt>vecBC</tt> and <tt>listBC</tt> guarantees that the 
order of addition (push-back) of out-edges (children) will be preserved. Using the 
ordered containers <tt>multisetBC</tt> and <tt>setBC</tt> guarantees that out-edges
are ordered according to their target vertex descriptor, if that descriptor is an 
index (i.e., if <tt>VertexList</tt> is either <tt>vecBC</tt> or <tt>poolBC</tt>). 
In all other cases, the ordering of the out-edges (children) is undefined.

<p>
You will also want to take into account the differences in time and space
complexity for the various tree operations. Below we use <i>V</i> for
the total number of vertices in the tree, which is also equal to the total
number of edges (minus one).  Operations not discussed here are constant time.

<p>

<h4>Space Complexity</h4>

<p>
The selection of the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> affects the amount of space
overhead per edge in the graph object. In the order of least space to
most space, the selectors are <tt>vecBC</tt>, <tt>poolBC</tt>,
<tt>listBC</tt>, and <tt>setBC</tt>. The same arguments as in 
the section on <tt>VertexList</tt> apply here. The use of associative 
containers like <tt>setBC</tt> or <tt>unordered_setBC</tt> (and their 
"multi" counterparts) cause additional space overhead inherent to their
implementations, which is not strictly defined, but it is safe to assume 
it's more than any of the sequence containers (e.g., <tt>setBC</tt> would 
probably incur three pointers per element).

<p>

<h4>Time Complexity</h4>

<p>
In the following description of the time complexity for various
operations, we use <i>F</i> inside of the ``big-O'' notation to
express the average "fan-out" of the tree. Of course, in reality,
the average fan-out always works out to one (the number of edges is
equal to the number of vertices minus one). So, we are talking here
of the average fan-out in vertices affected by the operations.

<p>
 
<p> <p>
<ul>

<li>
<pre>
add_child_vertex(u,g)
</pre>
When the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> is a 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/SortedAssociativeContainer.html">SortedAssociativeContainer</a>
like <tt>std::set</tt>, the insertion of an edge involes a lookup and 
results in a time complexity of <i>O(log(F))</i>. 
When the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> is a 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/HashedAssociativeContainer.html">HashedAssociativeContainer</a>
like <tt>std::unordered_set</tt>, the insertion of an edge involes a 
constant-time "hashed" lookup and results in a time complexity of <i>O(1)</i>. 
When the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> types that model 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Sequence.html">Sequence</a>, 
the insertion is amortized constant time. 
For <tt>vecBC</tt>, this operation is amortized constant time, as it uses 
<tt>push_back()</tt> on a vector container. 
For <tt>poolBC</tt>, this operation is also amortized constant time overall, 
as it could use <tt>push_back()</tt> on a vector container, but when there are 
holes to be re-used, its complexity is constant time.
For <tt>listBC</tt>, this operations is constant time in the sense that it
uses <tt>push_back()</tt> on a list container, but it causes a dynamic allocation
of a new node, and such heap invocations are amortized constant time.
With either <tt>vecBC</tt> or <tt>poolBC</tt>, this operation will occasionally 
cause reallocated and the copying (or, moving in C++11) of all the out-edges.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
remove_branch(u,g)
</pre>
This operation is constant time for <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> being 
either <tt>listBC</tt> or <tt>poolBC</tt>, or for the unordered 
containers <tt>unordered_setBC</tt> and <tt>unordered_multisetBC</tt>.
For <tt>vecBC</tt>, this operation is <i>O(F)</i> copies of the 
edges (to "re-pack" the edges).
For ordered containers <tt>setBC</tt> and <tt>multisetBC</tt>, 
this operation is <i>O(log(F))</i>.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
edge(u,v,g)
</pre>
The time complexity for this operation is <i>O(F)</i> when the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> type is a 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Sequence.html">Sequence</a> (<tt>vecBC</tt>, <tt>listBC</tt>, or <tt>poolBC</tt>), 
it is <i>O(log(F))</i> when the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> type is a 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/SortedAssociativeContainer.html">SortedAssociativeContainer</a> (<tt>setBC</tt> or <tt>multisetBC</tt>),
and it is <i>O(1)</i> when the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> type is a 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/HashedAssociativeContainer.html">HashedAssociativeContainer</a> (<tt>unordered_setBC</tt> or <tt>unordered_multisetBC</tt>).
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
out_edge_iterator::operator++()
</pre>
This operation is constant time in all cases.
However, there is a significant constant factor time difference
between the various types, which is important since this operation is
the work-horse of many graph algorithms. The speed of
this operation in order of fastest to slowest is
<tt>vecBC</tt>, <tt>poolBC</tt>, <tt>listBC</tt>, <tt>setBC</tt>,
<tt>unordered_setBC</tt>.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
in_edge_iterator::operator++()
</pre>
This operation is constant time and exhibits the same speed
for any <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> selection.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
vertex_iterator::operator++()
</pre>
This operation is constant time. The selection of <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> does not 
affect the speed of this operation.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
edge_iterator::operator++()
</pre>
This operation is constant time and exhibits similar speeds 
as the <tt>out_edge_iterator</tt> with respect to the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt>
selection, but is also affected by <tt>VertexList</tt> as it relies on an iteration
over vertices (i.e., edge iterators are actually iterators over all out-edges of all 
vertices). Traversing through the whole edge set is <i>O(V)</i>.
<p></p>

<li>
<pre>
adjacency_iterator::operator++()

child_vertex_iterator::operator++()
</pre>
This operation is constant time and exhibits a similar speed
ordering as the <tt>out_edge_iterator</tt> with respect to
the <tt>OutEdgeList</tt> selection.
<p></p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="sec:linked-tree-properties"></a>
Internal Properties
</h2>

<p>
Properties can be attached to the vertices or edges of an
<tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> tree via the property interface.  The template
arguments <tt>VertexProperty</tt> and <tt>EdgeProperty</tt> of the
<tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> class are meant to be filled by these interior 
properties.

<p><b>NOTE</b>: The Boost Graph Library supports two interchangeable methods for 
specifying interior properties: <a href="bundles.html">bundled properties</a> 
and property lists. The former is easier to use and requires less effort, 
whereas the latter is backward-compatible with Boost versions prior to 1.32.0. 
If you absolutely require these compatibility features, read on to learn about property lists. 
Otherwise, we strongly suggest that you read about the <a href="bundles.html">bundled
properties</a> mechanism. The implementation of <tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> is primarily
geared towards the use of bundled properties, and so, this is an additional 
incentive to choose bundled properties.

<p>
From this point on, the use of property lists in either <tt>adjacency_list</tt> or <tt>linked_tree_BC</tt>
are identical, and so, please see the section on <a
href="./using_adjacency_list.html#sec:adjacency-list-properties">Internal
Properties</a> from the <tt>adjacency_list</tt> page.

<p>

<h2><a name="sec:custom-storage"></a>
Customizing the Linked-Tree Storage
</h2>

<p>
The <tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> class template cannot safely provide such 
mechanisms. The library maintainers can be contacted through the mailing 
list if there are any suggestions of additional container options. But 
given the fact that any alternative container that one might wish to 
use would most likely involve some special feature in terms of complexity 
of operations or in terms of descriptor / iterator invalidation, it 
seems obvious that such a new container would have to be fully integrated 
into the implementation of <tt>linked_tree_BC</tt> to take advantage of 
those additional benefits (as is already the case for each of the 
options available) whenever possible.
