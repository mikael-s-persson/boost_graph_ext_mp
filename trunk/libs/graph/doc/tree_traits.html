Trees being a special kind of graph will have all the <a href="./graph_traits.html">graph-traits</a>,
along with a few specialized traits. This page describes those additional
traits that trees have, and which are used in some <a href="./tree_concepts.html">tree concepts</a>.
Given that graph-traits are already very rich in terms of associated types, 
there is very little need for more. The only extra associated type that 
tree-traits provide is the <tt>child_vertex_iterator</tt>, which is conceptually
equivalent to a graph's <tt>adjacency_iterator</tt>.
When implementing a tree class that fullfils one or more graph or tree concepts, 
for associated types that are not required by the concepts, it is ok to 
use <tt>void</tt> as the type (when using nested typedefs inside the graph/tree class), 
or to leave the typedef out of the <tt>graph_traits</tt> and <tt>tree_traits</tt> 
specialization for the graph/tree class.
Note that because of the use of traits classes rather than member
types, it is not safe (and often will not work) to define subclasses of BGL
graph/tree types; those types may be missing important traits and properties that
were defined externally to the class definition.

<pre>
  template &lt;typename Tree&gt;
  struct tree_traits {
    
    typedef typename Tree::child_vertex_iterator  child_vertex_iterator;
    
    // or, if Tree::child_vertex_iterator does not exist, then this is used:
    // typedef typename graph_traits&lt;Tree&gt;::adjacency_iterator  child_vertex_iterator;
  };
</pre>
